we made a digital button connected to digital input 2 on the phat
now we want to take a picture in cam.py when button pressed 
or turn off the PI when button pressed for long. 
see lines 625ff in cam.py for most recent attempt. 

things to do next time: 
- what did pimoroni reply on the hackr email
- make hackr work
- make display work
- make button work/done

Things written there stilll have to be done, there are a few new things to be done

python:
-we need an exit button that turns off everything
-a turn on button(we want to turn on and off the camera )
-save the analog data in a clean way so that we can read them/ now it saves two files: one where it stores all the data and one to be used by processing that get written new for each picture.


processing:
-how to read a new file each time
-be sure that the file has been saved before exit
-choose a mod
-understand the range to be used with the chosen mod and understand how to map the analog data
-how to get the data in / understoooood!/ now I need to map it and get new values
-modify the script in a way we like (it's going to be great to be at this point)


hardware:
-we need to understand if our screen would work, if not possible to make it work we need to find one that works through HDMI
-map sensors
